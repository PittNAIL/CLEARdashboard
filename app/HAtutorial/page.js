          Before someone gets hearing aids, a hearing test can help determine if the person is a good match for
          Direct-to-Consumer hearing aids. It may show that they need prescription hearing aids and services from a
          hearing care expert. The hearing test also checks if they need medical care prior to buying any type of
          hearing aid.

            The human ear consists of four major parts. The outer ear, the middle ear, the inner ear, and the auditory
            nervous system are these parts. Each part has a complex function in the reception, transmission, and
            processing of sound.
            <br />
            Outer ear: The outer ear is the part of your ear that you can see on the outside of your head. It includes
            the earlobe and the curved, fleshy part that surrounds the opening of your ear. The main job of the outer
            ear is to collect sound waves from the environment and funnel them into the ear canal, which leads to the
            middle ear. This helps us hear sounds from the world around us.
            <br />
            Middle ear: The middle ear is a small part of your ear located between the outer ear (the part that you can
            see) and the inner ear (deep inside your head). It includes the eardrum and three tiny bones called
            ossicles. These parts work together to transmit sound from the outer ear to the inner ear, allowing you to
            hear and understand sounds. So, the middle ear plays a crucial role in the process of hearing.
            <br />
            Inner ear: The inner ear is a small and important part of our ear that helps us hear and maintain our
            balance. It&#39;s located deep inside the ear and consists of a complex system of tiny structures and
            fluid-filled canals. The inner ear converts sound vibrations into electrical signals that our brain can
            understand, allowing us to hear. It also helps us keep our balance by sending information to the brain about
            the position and movement of our head. So, in simple terms, the inner ear is like our body&#39;s natural
            &#34;sound converter&#34; and &#34;balance keeper.&#34;
            <br />
            Auditory nervous system: The auditory nervous system is like the body’s “hearing network.” It includes all
            the parts in the body and brain that help you hear and understand sounds. When you listen to music, someone
            talking, or even a bird singing, your auditory nervous system is at work, helping you process and make sense
            of these sounds. It’s a crucial part of how we communicate and enjoy the world of sound around us.

                Hearing is one of our primary senses and is the process by which our ears detect and interpret sound
                waves in the surround environment. When you hear a sound, like a friend’s voice or music, it’s because
                of your ears. Sound is actually vibrations in the air. These vibrations travel to your ear, and your ear
                turns them into something your brain can understand. So, in simple terms, hearing is a process where
                your ears catch sound waves, your ear parts work together to transform these waves into signals for your
                brain, and your brain makes sense of these signals to let you understand and identify different sounds.{" "}

            TYPES OF HEARING LOSS
            <br />
            Sensorineural hearing loss: A sensorineural hearing loss happens when there&#39;s a problem with your inner
            ear or the nerves that carry sound to your brain. It can happen because of things like getting older, loud
            noises, certain medications, or health issues. With this kind of hearing loss, you might have trouble
            hearing soft sounds, understanding speech clearly, or catching high-pitched noises. It often sticks around
            and may need hearing aids or other devices to help you hear better. <br />
            <br />
            Conductive hearing loss: A conductive hearing loss happens when something in your ear, like earwax or an
            infection, makes it hard for sound to get through to your inner ear. It&#39;s like having a blockage in the
            way of sound, which can make things sound quieter or muffled. The good news is that this type of hearing
            loss can often be fixed with medical help, like cleaning your ears or treating infections. <br />
            <br />
            Mixed hearing loss: A mixed hearing loss happens when someone has two kinds of hearing problems at the same
            time. One problem is called sensorineural, which is about the inner ear or nerves that carry sound to the
            brain. The other problem is called conductive, which is when something in the outer or middle ear blocks the
            sound. So, in mixed hearing loss, someone might find it hard to hear sounds that are both soft and clear.
            They could have issues with the inside of the ear and also things in the ear canal like earwax or infections
            that make it even more difficult to hear. Treating this kind of hearing loss might involve using hearing
            aids or other devices, and sometimes, medical treatments like surgery or medicine.
            <br />
            <br />
            Central auditory processing disorder: A central auditory processing disorder (CAPD) means your brain has a
            bit of trouble understanding sounds, even when your ears are working okay. It&#39;s like the brain has a
            hard time sorting out and making sense of the things you hear. People with CAPD might find it tricky to
            follow instructions, especially in places with lots of noise, and they might get words mixed up that sound
            similar. It can make learning and talking a bit more challenging. Specialists like audiologists and speech
            pathologists can help a person with a central auditory processing disorder.

                Volume refers to how loud or soft a sound is. When something is very loud, it&#39;s at a high volume,
                and when it&#39;s quiet, it&#39;s at a low volume. For example, a rock concert is very high in volume,
                and a whisper is very low in volume. <br />

                understand it well, with no muffled or fuzzy parts. For instance, a clear phone call is one where the
                words are easy to understand, even if the volume is not very high.

            <br />
            Behind the Ear (BTE) Hearing Aid: BTEs rest behind the ear and are connected to a custom earmold or
            non-custom dome (for milder losses) that sits in the ear. The earmold option will provide better retention
            of the device because it is custom fit. The tube connecting the hearing aid to the part in the ear can be
            thick or slim depending on the individual’s hearing loss and preferences. These hearing aids can be used
            with mild-to-profound hearing losses of any configuration. <br />
            <br />
            Receiver in Canal (RIC) Hearing Aid: The Receiver-in-Canal hearing aids consist of two main components.
            First, there&#39;s a piece that sits behind the ear. This part is connected to an earpiece that fits inside
            the ear. The earpiece is either dome-shaped that sits in your ear or an earmold which is custom-made to fit
            your ear which keeps the device secure.
            <br />
            Now, when you look at RIC hearing aids, they resemble another type called BTE (Behind-the-Ear). However, the
            unique thing about RICs is that the loudspeaker, which we call the receiver, is placed inside the ear canal.
            This design choice allows the part behind the ear to be smaller and lighter. It can even have a larger
            battery, which means your hearing aid can work longer before needing a battery change.
            <br />
            To make all of this work, the two pieces, the one behind the ear and the earpiece inside the ear, are
            connected by a thin wire, not a thick tube. <br />
            <br />
            In-the-Ear (ITE) Hearing Aid: In-the-Ear hearing aid is made to fit inside the outer ear and ear canal. It
            is not very noticeable, so it’s a subtle way to improve your hearing. These hearing aids can be either
            standard or specially crafted or molded to match the person&#39;s ear shape. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            In-the-Canal (ITC) Hearing Aid: An In-the-Canal hearing aid is a smaller style of In-the-Ear hearing aid
            which fits in your ear canal. This device can be generic or custom molded to fit your ear for improved
            hearing. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Completely-in-Canal (CIC) Hearing Aid: A Completely-in-Canal hearing aid is a smaller style of In-the-Canal
            hearing aid which fits entirely in your ear canal. This device can be generic or custom molded to fit your
            ear. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Invisible in Canal (IIC) Hearing Aid: An Invisible-in-Canal hearing aid is a smaller style of Completely in
            Canal hearing aid that is worn deep in the ear canal making it very discrete and nearly invisible to other
            people depending on ear size. It is the smallest of all custom molded hearing aids. <br />
            <br />
            Cochlear Implant: A cochlear implant is a special device to help people who have severe hearing loss. It is
            surgically implanted. It&#39;s like a tiny computer that&#39;s placed in the ear to stimulate the hearing
            nerve, allowing the person to hear sounds more clearly. This device can be very helpful for those who
            can&#39;t benefit from regular hearing aids. <br />
            <br />
            Bone-Anchored Hearing Aid: A bone anchored hearing aid is a special device that helps people with a specific
            hearing problem. A hearing care expert is required for this solution. It&#39;s different from regular
            hearing aids because it provides sound through vibrations of the skull bone. Sometimes, it may require
            surgery for it to work.

              captures and prevents earwax and other particles from entering and clogging the sensitive parts of the
              device, which can affect its performance. The wax guards will need to be replaced, from time to time, so

                A disposable battery hearing aid is a small device that helps people with hearing problems hear better.
                It works using a regular, replaceable battery, similar to the ones you might use in a TV remote. When
                the battery runs out of power, you need to remove the old one and put in a new one. These hearing aids
                are usually easy to use and don&#39;t require charging. They make sounds louder so that people who have
                trouble hearing can understand conversations and other noises more clearly.

                Hearing aid batteries come in different sizes, and they are marked with numbers and colors to help you

              <span className="text-wrapper-6">
                1. Size 10 (Yellow tab): These are the smallest hearing aid batteries and are often used for tiny
                hearing aids. They don&#39;t last as long because they have less power.
                <br />

            <p className="text">
              <span className="text-wrapper-6">
                2. Size 312 (Brown tab): These are a bit larger than size 10 batteries and are suitable for various
                types of hearing aids. They have more power and a longer lifespan.
                <br />

              <span className="text-wrapper-6">
                3. Size 13 (Orange tab): These batteries are larger than both size 10 and size 312. They work well in
                different hearing aids and have a longer life compared to smaller sizes.
                <br />

              <span className="text-wrapper-6">
                4. Size 675 (Blue tab): Size 675 batteries are the largest and most powerful. They are used in larger
                hearing aids and last the longest.

                The choice of battery size depends on the specific hearing aid model and its power needs. It&#39;s
                crucial to use the right size to ensure your hearing aid functions correctly. Keep in mind that battery
                life can vary depending on factors such as the battery size, the hearing aid&#39;s power consumption,
                and usage. Regularly changing the batteries is important to avoid unexpected disruptions in your hearing
                aid&#39;s performance.

                A rechargeable hearing aid is a small device that helps people hear better when they have difficulty
                with their hearing. Unlike regular hearing aids that use disposable batteries, rechargeable hearing aids
                can be charged repeatedly, just like a smartphone. This means you don&#39;t need to buy new batteries
                all the time. To use a rechargeable hearing aid, you simply plug it into a special charger, and it
                stores energy for when you need it. Then, when you put it in your ear, it helps amplify sounds, making
                it easier for you to hear and understand what&#39;s being said around you. This can be very helpful for
                people who have trouble hearing well.

                Signal processing in hearing aids means the technology that works on sounds before they reach your ear.
                It can do things like making soft sounds louder, taking away noisy background sounds, and adjusting the
                sound for different pitches or tones. The main goal is to help people with hearing issues hear better
                and feel more comfortable.{" "}

          <p className="USING-a-HEARING-AID">
            USING A HEARING AID WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF TELEPHONES
            <br />A landline or cell phone can always be used with a hearing aid by holding the phone close to the
            hearing aid&#39;s microphone. The microphone is usually on or near the ear where the hearing aid is placed.
            Keeping the phone near the hearing aid helps the hearing aid pick up the sound from the phone&#39;s receiver
            (speaker), making it easier for you to hear the conversation. It is sometimes better to hold the phone’s
            receiver closer to the microphone of the hearing aid than up against your ear as you typically do. This way,
            you can have a clear and comfortable phone call. <br />
            Bluetooth (BT): Bluetooth allows things like your phone, headphones, and speakers connect with each other
            without any wires. They do this by sending signals with invisible radio waves, just like the signals from a
            radio station. This makes it super easy to link up devices without all those messy wires. 8-9 grade reading
            level
            <br />
            Streaming: Streaming means you are sending an audio signal into a hearing aid. The audio signal can be a
            phone call, music, or a phone alert. For example, when you’re talking on the phone, the sound from the call
            goes directly into your hearing aid. It’s like having the phone call play in your ear, making it easier to
            hear and understand the conversation without needing to hold the phone close to your ear. This helps people
            with hearing difficulties to have a clearer phone conversation. For streaming to take place, both your cell
            phone or tablet and your hearing aid must have Bluetooth capability. <br />
            Smartphone: A smartphone is a type of cell phone that allows a user to do more than make a phone call and
            send a text message. Additional features may include running programs on the phone like a computer, taking
            digital pictures, etc. controlled with a touchscreen. <br />
            Smartphone app: An app, which is just another name for an application, is a small computer program that you
            can download on your smartphone or tablet. After you download it, you can use the app to do a variety of
            tasks on your mobile device, such as playing games or checking the weather. 8-9 grade reading level
            <br />
            Hearing aid smartphone app: A hearing aid smartphone app allows the user to control certain features of the
            hearing aid for ease of use such as volume, multiple programs, other adjustments, etc. by using the
            touchscreen of the smartphone.
            <br />
            Telecoil: A telecoil or t-coil is a special feature in a hearing aid. It is sometimes known as a T-switch.
            The telecoil allows the wearer’s hearing aid to connect to certain phones or assistive listening devices to
            improve the sound or signal that is delivered to the hearing aid especially in nosier places. Since a
            telecoil requires an induction coil or wire in the hearing aid it can influence the size of the hearing aid.
            Using a telecoil and streaming are two different features and not the same thing.

                An Audio-Induction Hearing Loop is sometimes called a Hearing Loop or Audio Induction Loop. A hearing
                loop is a special system you can find in places like theaters, churches, auditoriums, or other big
                rooms. It has a wire loop or cable that&#39;s linked to a microphone or a sound system. This wire
                creates a kind of magnetic field. If you have a hearing aid or a cochlear implant with a T-coil, it can
                catch this magnetic field. When you turn on the T-coil in your hearing aid or implant, it brings the
                sound straight into your device. This makes the sound clearer and blocks out other noises, so it&#39;s
                easier for people with hearing problems to hear better. A venue typically advertises or places a sign
                within the facility that they have a hearing loop. If you do not see any sign, inquire at the ticket box
                office or with the management of the venue to see if they have a hearing loop at their facility.

          WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN YOU HAVE A HEARING AID FIT WITH AN AUDIOLOGIST&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <br />
          Your hearing will be examined by an audiologist to determine the degree and type of your hearing problem.
          Then, they can recommend the right care for you. If your hearing problem can be corrected medically, they will
          send you to an Ear, Nose and Throat physician. If there is a not a medical problem and the issue is a
          permanent hearing loss, the audiologist will help you find solutions to your hearing problem. These solutions
          may include hearing aids. The programming of the hearing aids and other services are important to successful
          hearing aid use. The audiologist provides this personalized care. Fitting a hearing aid requires:
          <br />
          Accurate audiometric data.
          <br />
          In depth knowledge of the individual’s lifestyle, communication needs, hobbies, etc. so the
          <br />
          audiologist can match the technology to the individual.
          <br />
          Customized physical fit of the device (this is the coupling of the hearing aid to the ear which
          <br />
          needs to be comfortable and also appropriate to the demands of the hearing loss).
          <br />
          Customized acoustic fit (measuring the sound in the person’s ear canal to set the hearing aid).
          <br />
          People who get hearing aids usually have hearing loss for several years before they seek help. This means that
          the person has been listening through a filter and the person’s brain is tuned to the hearing loss. The person
          with hearing loss perceives listening through the hearing loss as “normal.” The treatment for hearing loss is
          returning an audible signal to the auditory pathway. To make sure the person can hear well with their hearing
          aids, it&#39;s essential to ensure they can hear quiet, moderate, and loud sounds at different pitches without
          any discomfort. The audiologist can&#39;t just ask the person with hearing loss if they like how the hearing
          aids sound, because they may not know what&#39;s right due to having hearing loss over the years. To set up a
          hearing aid properly, the audiologist puts a tiny microphone in the person&#39;s ear and checks how the
          hearing aid works with quiet, moderate, and loud sounds. This helps the audiologist adjust the hearing aid so
          that it makes sounds easy to hear at different pitches and volumes.
          <br />
          People who have gradually lost their hearing, which is common as people get older, need to wear their hearing
          aids all the time when they&#39;re awake for about 2-3 weeks to adjust to the new sounds. People who wear
          their hearing aids full time (when they are awake) get the most benefit. When they first start using the
          hearing aids, it&#39;s normal not to like them during the first week. That&#39;s because the brain isn&#39;t
          used to all the sounds they can hear now. They might feel like everything is too loud and noisy. But if they
          use the hearing aids all the time when they are awake, their brain gets used to these new sounds over a few
          weeks, and the annoying sounds become less noticeable. This adjustment won&#39;t happen if they only use the
          hearing aids sometimes. When people only use the hearing aids part-time, their brain doesn&#39;t fully adapt
          to the new sounds, and they might say that things are too loud and noisy, and it bothers them.
          <br />
          It&#39;s important that a person gets use to their hearing aids before deciding to keep them. That&#39;s why
          each state in the U.S. has a law that allows a person at least 30 days to decide whether prescription hearing
          aids are helping them and whether they want to keep or return them. If they return them, they should expect to
          receive a refund for the majority of what they have paid with a small amount being kept by the practice to
          cover the time dedicated to this process.
